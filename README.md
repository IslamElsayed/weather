# README

This README would normally document whatever steps are necessary to get the
application up and running.

Things you may want to cover:

* ruby: 2.5.1

*I had more time I'd write some test code and do more debugging on the weather gem that I"m using as it's not working properly in all cases I may even change it.
I have some local environment issue as my operating system dropped couple of days a go and a lot of dependencies are missing which is causing a headache to some some normal tasks.
